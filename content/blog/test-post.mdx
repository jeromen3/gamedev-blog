When I started this prototype, all I wanted was one thing:

Move a box across the screen.

That’s it. No physics. No animation. Just motion.

Somehow that turned into me learning more about **vectors, transforms, and coordinate systems** in one afternoon than I learned in a full semester of school.

## The Moment I Realized I Didn’t Understand “Movement"

The first version of my code looked like this:

```ts
box.x += 1;
